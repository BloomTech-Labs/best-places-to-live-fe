## Project Overview

https://trello.com/b/l0bCCsVD/labs15-best-places

https://www.notion.so/aaa6e045d4294a5ea5d39ed242bfb499?v=b13640a8b200421da503d6fabfd8be8b

Description:

Moving is an inevitable part of life that most people will experience. Often, there's buyer's remorse after the fact for one reason or another. With Let's Move Homie, we strive to get you as much information about a potential place to live in a quick, user friendly manner. Whether you want to look up a specific location you have in mind, or just want to scroll across a map and see how certain cities rank compared to others, Let's Move Homie is here to help.


### Key Features

-    Visitors and Users can search a city by address and view it on a map
-    Visitors and Users can browse top 10 popular U.S Cities
-    Visitors can create a user account with a username and password
-    Visitors can search by city and see 4 different statistics (more to come)
-    Visitors can create a profile that saves their favorite cities 

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React w/Hooks

Why we chose this framework:

-    React is one of the more popular front end frameworks after researching the market
-    React is the framework most of our team was the most comfortable and familiar with
-    Hooks are becoming more popular after our market research and we agreed we wanted to learn this as it was added to the Lambda curriculum after we finished our front end sprints


## Front End Libraries:

Font Awesome
Axios
Google-Maps-React
Styled-components

#### Front end deployed to Digital Ocean

#### https://github.com/labs15-best-places/backend built using:

#### Node.js

-    Node.js was the framework the team was most familiar with
-    After market research, Node.js is the most popular back end framework for newer companies


# APIs

## OAuth - Google & Facebook

Users can register using their Google or Facebook accounts


## https://datausa.io/about/api/

The Data USA API allows users to explore the entire database using carefully constructed query strings, returning data as JSON results.

## https://developers.teleport.org/api/

The Teleport API gives us additional information about US cities which makes it so we don't have to manually input city information. 

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

MONGO_USERNAME= MongoDB username
MONGO_PASSWORD= MongoDB username's password
MONGO_HOSTNAME= URI of where MongoDB is hosted
MONGO_PORT= MongoDB port
MONGO_DB= MongoDB name

GOOGLE_CLIENTID= Google Authentication API Client ID
GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET= Google Authentication API Client Secret

FACEBOOK_CLIENTID= Facebook Authentication API Client ID
FACEBOOK_CLIENTSECRET= Facebook Authentication API Client Secret

COOKIE_KEY= Cookie Key for Passportjs

# Testing

We used cypress for testing because it was something we didn't know much about but our team wanted to learn and we had an expert on the team
