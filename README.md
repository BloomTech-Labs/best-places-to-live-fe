## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React w/Hooks

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?

-    React is one of the more popular front end frameworks after researching the market
-    React is the framework most of our team was the most comfortable and familiar with
-    Hooks are becoming more popular after our market research and we agreed we wanted to learn this as it was added to the Lambda curriculum after we finished our front end sprints


üö´List the rest of the front end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above.

## Front End Libraries:

Font Awesome
Axios
Google-Maps-React
Styled-components

#### Front end deployed to Digital Ocean

#### https://github.com/labs15-best-places/backend built using:

#### Node.js

-    Node.js was the framework the team was most familiar with
-    After market research, Node.js is the most popular back end framework for newer companies

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

MONGO_HOSTNAME= URI of where MongoDB is hosted
MONGO_PORT= MongoDB port
MONGO_DB= MongoDB name

GOOGLE_CLIENTID= Google Authentication API Client ID

FACEBOOK_CLIENTID= Facebook Authentication API Client ID
FACEBOOK_CLIENTSECRET= Facebook Authentication API Client Secret

COOKIE_KEY= Cookie Key for Passportjs
